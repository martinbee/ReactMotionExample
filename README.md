# ReactMotionExample

All examples are using Motion and spring provided by react-motion.

## Example 1

Simple Motion component that demonstrates how the spring value is passed to the
components children and how it incremments.

## Example 2

Motion component that uses a more typical function structure and passes the
spring value to the child's opacity. The default x value is 10 so the
child goes from full opacity down to 0.


## Example 3

Motion component that uses the spring value to change font size.
